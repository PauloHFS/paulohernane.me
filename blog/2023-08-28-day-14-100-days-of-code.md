Today I start to solve a colab notebook from college. In this notebook, I use the pandas library to read a csv file and do some data analysis. The dataset that I used was [this](https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fspscientist%2Fstudents-performance-in-exams). The focus of this notebook was to use the [plotly](https://plotly.com/python) library to create some graphs.
