        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code is a skill that you need to practice every day. But some days we don't are in the mood to code, but we fell anxious about it. So, I will share with you some tips that I use to code every day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-create-a-routine">1. Create a routine<a href="#1-create-a-routine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Create a routine" title="Direct link to 1. Create a routine">​</a></h2><p>The first step is to create a routine. You need to define a time to code every day. It can be 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. The important thing is to code every day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-a-coding-menu">2. Create a Coding Menu<a href="#2-create-a-coding-menu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Create a Coding Menu" title="Direct link to 2. Create a Coding Menu">​</a></h2><p>Some times we want to code but we don't know what to. So create a Coding Menu that you can always look and choose a thing to code based on the time and mood that you have.</p><p>A Coding Menu is a list of projects/exercises that you may want to work on. You need to split they on blocks of times, for example, a exercise that you can do in 30 minutes, a project that you can do in 1 hour, and so on. A example:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th>Activity</th><th>Links/Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30 minutes</td><td>Micro-Projects</td><td><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/</a></td></tr><tr><td>30 minutes</td><td>Programming Challenges</td><td><a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://leetcode.com/</a></td></tr><tr><td>1 hour</td><td>Plan &amp; Build a Project</td><td>Create something that you may use</td></tr><tr><td>1 hour</td><td>Study alongside you apply</td><td><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/</a></td></tr><tr><td>2.5+ hours</td><td>Work on a Project</td><td>Work hard on a project that you want to finish</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Time is just a example, you can change it to fit your routine. Always ask how much time do you have!</em></p><p><em>Activity is just a example, must be something fun that you can do, try to build projects!</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="userful-links">Userful Links<a href="#userful-links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Userful Links" title="Direct link to Userful Links">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/a0eB7tMkvs4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Code Everyday - bigboxSWE</a></p>]]></content>
