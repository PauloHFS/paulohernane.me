Today I finished the second lab for my Data Science class, I used Pandas and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library to plot some histograms and boxplots, maybe I would write a post about it soon. You can check the notebook [here](https://github.com/PauloHFS/descriptive-data-analysis-2023-1/blob/main/Lab2A_EDA%2C_Histogramas%2C_Sumarizacao.ipynb).

I also study English and Concurrent Program to a exam that I will have tomorrow.
