Today I start to build a prof of concept to test some concepts like Idempotency, Batch Processing, Circuit Breaker, background jobs, and message queues. I build this project relearn how to configure node with typescript and build the project with Dockerfile and run a infra local with docker-compose. [Here](https://github.com/PauloHFS/idempotency-poc) you can see the source code. Alongside I start to learn more about IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
