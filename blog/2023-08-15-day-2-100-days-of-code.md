Today was a really full day of work, I have been working to finish a project that I have been working on for a while from the company that I work for, so I didn't have much time to code, but I managed to do some things.

First of all I study again some concepts of Data Structure, more precisely, about the Binary Search Tree, I have been studying this topic for a while at the college, but I think that I need to study more about it because a will need to use this concepts soon on a exam, so I will do it in the next days. [Here](https://github.com/PauloHFS/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/tree) is the code that I wrote today and some references that I used to study.

After that I work a lot to finish a project for the company that I work. As good cause I can apply some concepts that I learn about Next.js and Typescript like [React Composition](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/) as a example.

At the end of the day I had a English Class that we discussed about the weather, before that I call with my cousin that is a SE in a company from Canada, we talk a lot about my graduation, my studies, jobs in SE, immigration and english, was really nice to collects some career insights.
