Today I start to integrate Supabase to my project using the expo, I also learn about the new expo router and how to use it.

Using the Supabase I start to learn some new thing like: Row Level Security, Stored Procedures, Triggers, PL/pgSQL, and Functions.

I also learn more about the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and how to use it.
