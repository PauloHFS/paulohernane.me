# Mutual Exclusion Algorithms

This Algorithms has the objective to solve the problem of the critical region, where only one process can be at a time to prevent race condition, deadlocks and data inconsistences. This is called **Mutual Exclusion**.

Some algorithms are:

- Lock One
- Lock Two
- Peterson's Algorithm
- Bakery Algorithm
- TAS Lock
