# Scientific method

> This is my notes taken on the course of scientific method.

Main methods of scientific research:

1. Experimentation
2. Description
3. Comparative
4. Modeling
5. Survey

Usually are used combined to get data, and generate knowledge.

Study of case, is a method that is used to study a specific case, and then compare with other cases.

Survey is the method that will be studied in this discipline

"Against method - outline of an anarchistic theory of knowledge" - Paul Feyerabend

- no theory explains everything.
- you should not be afraid of having ideas not validated.
- open science.

## Experimentation Method

Search the relation between 2 or more variables, where at least one is manipulated and the other is observed.

In this method, we work with two groups:

- Negative control: no treatment (Placebo)
- Positive control: treatment with known effect

The negative group is used as the base line, to compare with the positive group. The positive group is used to validate the experiment.

- Changes in only one variable, if we fix or remove the other variable, the scenario will be realistic?
- Variables can be controlled?
- The experiment is repeatable?
- The experiment need to show the strong causality between the variables.
- Limitations of the experiment. (Time, money, Ethics, etc)

## Description Method or Study of Case Descriptive

This method is used to collect data about the phenomenon and/or the relation between they and observe and measure behave.

Example: observe users and collect user stories on Software Engineer.

1. observation and description about the phenomenon, this need to make this reproducible.
2. use the evident collected on 1 to generate hypothesis that will explain the phenomenon.
3. test the hypothesis, using more research, etc.
4. if the hypothesis is validated, it will be used to generate a theory.

This method can be only exploratory, without hypothesis, and only collect data. Sometimes this can be used with other methods.

- Experimentation: collect data about the variables and the system before experimentation. Example: collect data about radiation on the people, is not a good idea to irradiate people in a experiment, so collect data on people who have received radiation is a good idea to create a hypothesis.
- comparative: collect data about the variables and the system before comparative. Example: collect data about the people who have received a treatment, and compare with people who have not received the treatment.
- modeling: models need to be derived from data, so collect data is a good idea to create a model.

## Comparative Method

This method is used to compare two or more groups, and search for differences and similarities.

Example: compare the effect of gender on the salary.

- The groups need to be similar, and the only difference is the variable that will be studied.
- The groups need to be large enough to be statistically significant.
- The groups need to be random, to avoid bias.

### Whem to use

- The objective is to know the differences and similarity between groups.
- Time prevent experiment.
- Ethical reasons prevent experiment.

## Modeling Method

This method is used to create a model of the phenomenon, and then use the model to predict the behavior of the phenomenon. Like a simulation. Sometimes is impossible or dangerous to work and observe the phenomenon.
