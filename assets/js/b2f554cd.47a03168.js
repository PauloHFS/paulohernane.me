But some days we don\'t are in the mood to code, but we fell anxious about it. So, I will share with you some tips that I use to code every day.\\n\\n## 1. Create a routine\\n\\nThe first step is to create a routine. You need to define a time to code every day. It can be 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. The important thing is to code every day.\\n\\n## 2. Create a Coding Menu\\n\\nSome times we want to code but we don\'t know what to. So create a Coding Menu that you can always look and choose a thing to code based on the time and mood that you have.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nA Coding Menu is a list of projects/exercises that you may want to work on. You need to split they on blocks of times, for example, a exercise that you can do in 30 minutes, a project that you can do in 1 hour, and so on. A example:\\n\\n| Time | Activity | Links/Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 30 minutes | Micro-Projects | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/> |\\n| 30 minutes | Programming Challenges | <https://leetcode.com/> |\\n| 1 hour | Plan & Build a Project | Create something that you may use |\\n| 1 hour | Study alongside you apply | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/> |\\n| 2.5+ hours | Work on a Project | Work hard on a project that you want to finish |\\n\\n*Time is just a example, you can change it to fit your routine.
