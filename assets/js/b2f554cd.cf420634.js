But some days we don\'t are in the mood to code, but we fell anxious about it. So, I will share with you some tips that I use to code every day.\\n\\n## 1. Create a routine\\n\\nThe first step is to create a routine. You need to define a time to code every day. It can be 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. The important thing is to code every day.\\n\\n## 2. Create a Coding Menu\\n\\nSome times we want to code but we don\'t know what to. So create a Coding Menu that you can always look and choose a thing to code based on the time and mood that you have.\\n\\nA Coding Menu is a list of projects/exercises that you may want to work on. You need to split they on blocks of times, for example, a exercise that you can do in 30 minutes, a project that you can do in 1 hour, and so on. A example:\\n\\n| Time | Activity | Links/Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 30 minutes | Micro-Projects | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/> |\\n| 30 minutes | Programming Challenges | <https://leetcode.com/> |\\n| 1 hour | Plan & Build a Project | Create something that you may use |\\n| 1 hour | Study alongside you apply | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/> |\\n| 2.5+ hours | Work on a Project | Work hard on a project that you want to finish |\\n\\n*Time is just a example, you can change it to fit your routine. Always ask how much time do you have!*\\n\\n*Activity is just a example, must be something fun that you can do, try to build projects!*\\n\\n## Userful Links\\n\\n[How To Code Everyday - bigboxSWE](https://youtu.be/a0eB7tMkvs4)"},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-18-hello-world.md","title":"Hello World","description":"","date":"2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello-world","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello-world"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Hernane Fontes e Silva","title":"Entry-Level Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/paulohfs","imageURL":"https://github.com/paulohfs.png","key":"paulohfs"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-world","title":"Hello World","authors":"paulohfs","tags":["hello-world","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Code Everyday","permalink":"/blog/how-to-code-everyday"}},"content":""}]}')}}]);
